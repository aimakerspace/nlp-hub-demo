  //     "Lark Force was an Australian Army formation established in March 1941 during World War II for service in New Britain and New Ireland . Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John Scanlan , it was raised in Australia and deployed to Rabaul and Kavieng , aboard SS Katoomba , MV Neptuna and HMAT Zealandia , to defend their strategically important harbours and airfields . The objective of the force , was to maintain a forward air observation line as long as possible and to make the enemy fight for this line rather than abandon it at the first threat as the force was considered too small to withstand any invasion . Most of Lark Force was captured by the Imperial Japanese Army after Rabaul and Kavieng were captured in January 1942 . The officers of Lark Force were transported to Japan , however the NCOs and men were unfortunately torpedoed by the USS Sturgeon while being transported aboard the Montevideo Maru . Only a handful of the Japanese crew were rescued , with none of the between 1,050 and 1,053 prisoners aboard surviving as they were still locked below deck .",

      "Miguel Riofrio S\u00e1nchez ( September 7 , 1822 \u2013 October 11 , 1879 ) was an Ecuadoran poet , novelist , journalist , orator , and educator . He was born in the city of Loja . He is best known today as the author of Ecuador 's first novel La Emancipada ( 1863 ) . Owing to the book 's length , usually less than 100 pages long , many experts have argued that it is really a novella rather than a full novel , and that Ecuador 's first novel is Juan Le\u00f3n Mera 's Cumanda ( 1879 ) . Nevertheless , thanks to the arguments of the well - known and respected Ecuadorian writer Alejandro Carri\u00f3n ( 1915 \u2013 1992 ) , Miguel Riofr\u00edo 's La Emancipada has been accepted as Ecuador 's first novel . Riofrio died in exile in Peru .",
