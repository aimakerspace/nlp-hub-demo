        <b>Rumour Detection</b> is the task of determining whether the source clain is
        a True Rumour, a False Rumour, or an Unverified Rumour. When the model
        is confident of the rumour's veracity, it will tag the post as a True
        Rumour or a False Rumour. Posts will be tagged as an Unverified Rumour
        when more information is required.<br/> <b>Stance Classification</b> is the task
        to annotate each of the reply posts with a stance label towards the
        source claim, namely: support, deny, query, and comment.
